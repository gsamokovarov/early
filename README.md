# Early

Early checks for environment variables availability, so you don't have to. Hook
it early in your program to require or default a variable and then work with
`ENV` like you normally would. Extremely useful for [Twelve-Factor apps][12f].

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'early'
```

Afterwards make sure to call `Early` as early as possible in your application,
to check the `ENV` variables, before you use them in your configuration layer.

## Usage

```ruby
Early do
  require :REDIS_URL
  default :PROVIDER, :generic
end
```
